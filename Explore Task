2A-Row 2:  This Application's main purpose is communication,
bringing the world more closer together and be more conntected with
our friends, our family or loved ones even if they are too far away, 
an example would be a different country. 

2B- :Facebook was made with many different computing systems, the operating system
Mark used to build facebook was Linux, the server he used was Apache, the DataBbase was MySQL
and the scripting language he used was PHP.

2C-Row 3-4-5: Communication is very important to us as humans, we do 
communicate to get jobs done and we communicate to learn more about 
others there are many positives effects but also negatives of internet 
communication. Facebook allows you to keep in touch with family and 
friends that live far away, with instant messaging and video chat 
you can share information across the world, it can keep you updated
about them too. There are also negative effects of facebook, you can 
get bullied on it, Facebook is very good for communicating but some people
use it as a weapon to weaken or mistreat another user on facebook, they 
can harass you and keep creating new accounts even if you blocked them,
alot of teens gets bullied on facebook whether that would be their looks,
skin color, or IQ level. Online communication is taking the 21st century
by storm, more than ever people has been talking to other people on an electronic
screen than talking to them in person using facebook is basically in our daily
lives. Facebook, online chats and communication applications has made people
less active in real life, it has made people want to talk electronically rather than 
an in real life converstation, and this negatively impacts their social life. it has also 
positively impacted individuals and society, people from across the world use facebook 
to talk to their family and this communication is free and much easier to talk rather than
visiting them across the ocean.

2DRow 6-7:Facebook uses data from feedback, after using the video chats or texting app, 
facebook asks for a feedback, and if the person writes a feedback to facebook, they use
this data/information to see what people want, after they would transform and implement the 
data into future updates so it pleases their users, and it should run smoother, bugs fixed
and most of all more choices and options to communicate with another person. Facebook has 
benefited alot some people but has also harmed them too, once in a while a hacker 
seems to have tresspassed the facebook data security systems, after 
doing that the hacker can choose expose the persons information whether that would 
be a location, a secret or information in generaland they can use this to hurt the 
individuals character.
